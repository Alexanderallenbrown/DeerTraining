Experiment 1
Date 02/26/19 - 02/27/19
MPC: Fb_KinCar
Parameters: 
q_lane_error = 10
q_obstacle_error =0
q_lateral_velocity=1.0
q_steering_effort=1.0,q_accel = 0.005

Old deer tested in open field, and single_tree_60
Mean of results used to determine speed reduction, given distance < 2.0m
Maximum generation at which min speed is found = 20

Test canceled to begin testing using minimum score rather than average score
